# Sample Outline

You should create a detailed outline for your book. A well crafted outline can become the Table of Contents. There is probably no need to go more than 3 levels deep. Think of each level as a section heading.

I'd suggest structuring like this:

```text
1) Chapter Title
    a)	Main Section
        i)	Sub-Heading
        ii)	Sub-Heading
    b)	Main Section
        i)	Sub-heading
            (1)	Detail Heading
            (2)	Detail Heading
    c)	Main Section
2) Chapter Title
    a)	Main Section
        i)	Sub-Heading
        ii)	Sub-Heading
        iii)	Sub-heading
    b)	Main Section
...
```

You probably won't have to worry about including an index. If you are going with a traditional publisher, they will handle that process. If you are self-publishing, you are likely going digital which makes indexing a waste of time given the ability to search digital content.

One brief word on Appendices. The only reason to include content as an Appendix chapter is because you have additional content you feel is important to the reader but it doesn't really fit into the main narrative. For example, you might have an appendix that provides detailed instructions on setting up a lab environment. Anything in the appendix should be considered extra material that if skipped, won't affect the reader's experience with your book. If they need to know it, then it goes in the main content.
