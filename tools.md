# Tools

Here is a list of tools and software you might find helpful in writing your first book. Some of the tools may be available in a bundle. Many of these I have used and can recommend.

## Image Capture

[Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) is the only tool I use.

## Video Capture

[Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is the only tool I use. Although if you have a Mac you likely have additional options.

## Markdown Tools

I have used [MarkdownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/) in the past before I switched to use VS Code for all my work. I also discovered [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) which looks interesting and might fill a different need. I found this [list of Markdown editors](https://speckyboy.com/markdown-tools-editors/) you might want to read.

## Code Editors

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[Atom](https://atom.io/)
[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

## Virtualization

If you are running Windows 8 or later, you can take advantage of Hyper-V to create a virtual environment. You can create Windows virtual machines with evaluation copies of Microsoft products. Other options you might consider are [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) or [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html) for those of you of the Apple persuasion. An open source option I've used in the past is [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
